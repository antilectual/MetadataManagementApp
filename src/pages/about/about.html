    Hi, my name is Brianna. I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at the University of Nevada, Reno. My involvement in the implementation of the application was mainly on the backend. I was responsible for parsing and formatting the Ontology data, data conversion, and building and hosting the web service.

    Hello, my name is Christopher and I am Computer Science & Engineering undergraduate at University of Nevada, Reno. I worked primarily on the front end and UI design for the application. That required me me to design in Photoshop, and code in typescript and html. I was also the co-manager on the project. I hope you enjoy our hard work.
